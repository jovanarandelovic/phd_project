The scripts were used for running differential RNA-seq analysis after Brachyury transcription factor perturbation in sea urchin embryos (S. purpuratus  and P. lividus).

Brachyury ChIP-seq and wild type ATAC-seq narrowPeak data was used to check for Brachyury motif presence around affected genes after Bra perturabtion.
